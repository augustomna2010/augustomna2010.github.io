Since today I'll try commit everyday, write a article everyweek, learn everyminute, stop procrastinating and start my new life.
I think that life is a bigger thing and I can't stop I need continue.
I'm a person kind that wanna change the world I don't know how I will do it but I will.
The only thing I will never do is betray my friends


### Some phrases that I like:
1. Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary
2. If you don't prioritize your life, someone else will.
3. Anyone who stops learning is old.
4. Not exists hard dream, exists how willing you are for run behind it
